* mixed_context -> generates and solves a matrix using scalapack.
* hw -> MPI hello world
* hwloc-hello -> prints the processing unit the process is bound to
* topo_check -> MPI hello world plus PU #
* topo_disco -> gets topology information and prints it
* mixed_hw -> MPI+OpenMP hello world where the first part has n processes 
  and 1 thread per process, and then the second part uses n/m processes, and 
  m threads per process.
* mixed_skel -> prototype of calling and return models
