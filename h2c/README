PURPOSE

This is a modified (by Ben Allan) version of mcpp that (under the right switches) generates
filtered, depth and line numbered dependency output.
A patch file (vs the mcpp272 source) is included (but already applied in this tree).

h2c.sh header to c file converter.

An example (very brittle) script using the generated line numbers is h2c.sh, a tool for
converting a dir full of c headers into a generated dir full of .c files derived from those
headers. Note: h2c.sh does not work unless input locations hardcoded at the top 
exist and local (to whereever you run the script from) output dirs cheaders and dfiles have
been manually created.

The purpose of h2c.sh (and this modified mcpp) is to prepare batches of header files for transformation by
tools which only transform input .c ( and probably c++) and not .h files.
Each header is converted to a .c file with the addition of a 2line prolog and 2line epilog.
A needed companion header is generated.

INSTALL

When building this package, specify --program-prefix=ba and a --prefix, or you get the standard
mcpp binary name and an attempt to install in /usr/local.
The h2c.sh script is not installed and must be copied & tailored to each use.

See the full readme in mcpp for details.
