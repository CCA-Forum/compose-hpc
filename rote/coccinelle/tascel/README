---------TASCEL TRANSFORMATION README------------


Software Requirements
---------------------

1. CMAKE (Binaries available)

   http://cmake.org/

2. ROSE

   http://www.rosecompiler.org/

3. Coccinelle version (>= 1.0.0-rc9)

   http://coccinelle.lip6.fr/   

4. Python

   http://python.org

Environment variables needed:
-------------------------------

#The following environment variables need to be set

ROSE_HOME = path-to-rose-installation
BOOST_HOME = path-to-boost-installation
PAUL_HOME = path-to-libpaul (in compose-repo-root/paul/libpaul)

- Coccinelle version (>= 1.0.0-rc9) is needed
  for this transformation to work as desired.

- The input test file to be transformed should COMPILE
  without any errors. 
  - See tests/twoel_0.c for example.


BUILD Sources 
-------------
mkdir build && cd build
cmake..
make


Running a sample transformation
-------------------------------
- The script Tascel.py folder is used
  to run the transformation.

- The options to this script are
  ./Tascel.py path-to-input-file version 
  
- python Tascel.py tests/twoel_0.c  0 
  produces rose_trans_twoel_0.c which is equivalent to twoel_1.c without
  annotations that drive the transformation to produce the subsequent 
  version (twoel_2.C)
  
- python Tascel.py tests/twoel_1.c  1
  produces rose_trans_twoel_1.C which is equivalent to twoel_2.C. This version is
  converted to C++ code which is further annotated so that the ROSE front-end could
  process it without any errors when the transformation tries to generate the
  final version. 


Actions performed by the Tascel.py script
----------------------------------------------

  - Assume test.c is the source file.
  - A SimpleTranslator built using ROSE processes the input file
    builds an AST and unparses it to generate rose_test.c
  - If autoAnnot option is provided rose_test.c is annotated
    and a new file rose_trans_test.c is generated with all
    desired calls (like next_4chunk()) annotated. If autoAnnot is not provided
    rose_trans_test.c would be a simple duplicate of rose_test.c
  - rose_trans_test.c is processed by PAUL and rose_trans_test_tascel.cocci
      is generated. This .cocci file is used by Coccinelle
      to generate the final transformed code containing the transformed code
      named rose_trans_test_tascel.c

  NOTE: This script could be run from any location on your machine.
        All the files generated as part of the transformation are
        placed in the same directory as the original source file.
