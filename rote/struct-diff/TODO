Todo list:
----------

1. Script to take a diff-like format, and produce the corresponding pre/post source files for generating the tree diff.

2. Generalization via matching of subtrees and replacement with stratego variable terms.

3. Annotation guidance?  Look at how annotations from PAUL show up in the aterms.

4. Still seeing single quotes in the terms, and the trailing period.  Need to put filtering in the src2term/term2src scripts.

5. How to handle Left/Right holes.  Current code only addresses MisMatch nodes in the weavetree.
