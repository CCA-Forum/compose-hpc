To build:

First, make sure you have a recent version of the Haskell platform.  This
code was developed on the 2012.2.0.0 release, based on GHC 7.4.1.

Next, make sure the aterm package is installed from hackage (this requires
a network connection).

% cabal install aterm

Then, configure the rule generator:

% cabal configure

Next, build the rule generator:

% cabal build

Finally, if you want the haddock documentation:

% cabal haddock --executables
