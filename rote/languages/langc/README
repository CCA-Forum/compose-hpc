Feel free to contact Geoff Hulette (ghulette@cs.uoregon.edu) if you need help
getting the demo working. Consider the following a quick primer for the
adventurous. You will need:

Haskell Platform >= 2010.2.0.0 http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/
Maude >= 2.5 http://maude.cs.uiuc.edu/download/
Ruby >= 1.8 http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/
GCC >= 3

You will also need a Haskell library called language-c which you can easily
install (once you have the Haskell platform) with this command:

$ cabal install language-c

To run the demo you must cd to this directory, and then run guard.rb on the
example C file.

$ ruby guard.rb examples/guard_ex1.c

This will (hopefully) print out the original C file, then the term
representation of the original code, then the term representation of the
rewritten code, and finally the unparsed and rewritten C file. The process
should transform the code such that the result from each malloc in the
original C program is checked for a null value, and the program terminated if
if is found.
