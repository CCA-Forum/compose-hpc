This program requires the source distribution of the Python version
you wish to work with since it uses the ASDL specification as well as 
the corresponding asdl.py parser module to determine what the python
AST structure is for serialization to aterms.

See the comments in the past.py code to set the path to the ASDL
file as well as the PYTHONPATH needed to fine the corresponding
asdl.py module containing the ASDL parser.
