REQUIREMENTS
============

  Braid is dependent on the installation of following software packages:

  * Python:         Version 2.6 or higher

  * Build-only:
  * Make:           GNU make version 3.74 or higher
  * SWI-Prolog:     Version 5.10.4 or higher 
   (only needed if you intend to modify [ir,sidl].def)

  * Doxygen:        Version 1.6 or higher 
   (disable with ./configure --disable-documentation)


  If you want to run the regression tests, you will also need:
  * Babel:          Version 2.0 or higher
  * Chapel:         Version 1.3.0
  * Java:           JVM 1.6 or higher
  * NumPy:          Version 1.0.4 or higher
  
  Please also see ../README for the complete list.


PROCESS
=======

  Assuming you are currently at the root of the package directory and
you have the necessary software and environment, which includes making
sure <INSTALL_DIR>/bin is in your environment, simply type the
following::

    $ mkdir build && cd build && ../configure --prefix=<INSTALL_DIR> && make install

  The chapel interoperability work currently needs a patched version
of the chapel compiler. For this, you need to
  
  1. first install the vanilla (unpatched) version of Chapel.

  2. configure Braid as above (but don't run `make install' yet)

  3. run
    $ bash ./patch-chapel-compiler.sh
    
  4. answer `yes'. The script will patch and recompile the compiler
  automatically. You can undo this operation by running  
      $ bash ./patch-chapel-compiler.sh --undo

  5. run 
    $ make install
