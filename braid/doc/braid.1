.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Braid 0.2.6 \- Do magically wonderful things with SIDL (scientific interface
definition language) files. BRAID is a high\-performance language
interoperability tool that generates Babel\-compatible bindings for the Chapel
programming language. For details on using the command\-line tool, please
consult the BRAID man page and the Babel user\(aqs guide.
.SS About BRAID and its relation to Babel
[image: logos/braid-logo-small.png]
.sp
BRAID, the Braid system for Rewriting Abstract Descriptions, is a
compiler\-like tool to generate the glue code necessary for language
interoperability. Developed by the Components project [1] at Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory, BRAID supports the Scientific Interface
Definition Language (SIDL) for the language\-independent declaration of
interfaces associated with scientific software packages.
.sp
The language bindings generated by BRAID are binary\-compatible to
those generated by the related Babel [2] tool. While Babel handles
traditional programming languages (such as C, C++, Fortran (77\-2008),
Python, and Java), BRAID adds support for modern PGAS [3] languages.
.sp
In practice, this means that if you want to, for example, let a Chapel
program use a component implemented in Fortran 95, you would invoke
Babel for the Fortran code and Braid for Chapel code:
.sp

.ft C

.SS Supported Languages
.sp
At this moment Chapel client code is well\-tested and considered
stable. Chapel server works also fairly well, however, the Chapel
compiler imposes the limitation that there can only be one copy
of the Chapel runtime system per executable (e.g., 1 Chapel library
\fIor\fP one Chapel \fCmain()\fP function).

.sp
In addition to all regular Babel/SIDL features, the Chapel backend
also extends the Chapel runtime to support \fIborrowed arrays\fP;
i.e., Arrays that are initialized by an external function and can be
passed to Chapel code without copying. It also provides an interface
for \fIdistributed arrays\fP which allow non\-Chapel code to access
non\-local data residing in the PGAS\-space.
.sp
The following features are not yet implemented:
.sp
Generic arrays, arrays of objects, structs, contracts, hooks and RMI.
.SS Installation
.sp
BRAID uses an autotools\-based build system, so the regular:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\&./configure && make install
.ft P
.fi
.sp
will work just fine. Below is the step\-by\-step break\-down of the the
.sp
installation process:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
tar xvf braid\-0.2.3.tar.bz2 && cd braid\-0.2.3
mkdir build && cd build
\&../configure \-\-prefix=<INSTALL_PATH>
make [\-j<N>] && make install

# other useful commands
\&../configure \-\-help
make check

.SS Compiling Chapel to run on SLURM\-managed Clusters with Infiniband
.sp
We found the following setup to be working with MPI (to spawn
processes) and direct Infiniband (for the actual communication).
.sp
It seems that Chapel (~1.5) cannot be compiled with a GCC version
newer than 4.6.X, because of issues with GASnet and the Chapel code
base. A known good version of GCC for compiling Chapel is 4.3.6.
To compile Chapel in CHPL_HOME use the following commands:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
export CHPL_COMM=gasnet
export CHPL_COMM_SUBSTRATE=ibv
make \-C ${CHPL_HOME}
.ft P
.fi
.sp
To initialize the environment (using bash) run:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
export CHPL_COMM=gasnet
export CHPL_COMM_SUBSTRATE=ibv
cd ${CHPL_HOME}
source util/setchplenv.bash
cd \-
.ft P
.fi
.sp
To run a Chapel program using Infiniband communication and MPI to spawn
new processes via SLURM:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
export MPIRUN_CMD="srun \-p<partition> \-N %N %P %A" # you can customize this
\&./program
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Those are substitutions made by Chapel (or GASnet), here is a list
taken from one of the Chapel\-internal Makefiles:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# The following substitutions are performed:
#   %P = program executable name
#   %N = requested node count
#   %A = program arguments
#   %Q = program arguments w/ an extra level of quotes
#   %D = the current working directory
#   %H = hostfile (if any)
CONDUIT_RUNCMD = mpirun \-np %N %P %A
.ft P
.fi
.sp
The way I understand it SLURM provides the mpirun launcher on the
machines it manages. Chapel/GASnet uses this mechanism to trick SLURM
into launching processes on multiple nodes. If you compiled Chapel
with the \(aqibv\(aq conduit, however, no actual communication will be done
over MPI, instead GASnet will directly use the Infiniband network to
exchange data between nodes.
.sp
Using Infiniband directly is supposed to perform better because MPI
apparently does not do one\-sided communication well.
.SS Patching the Chapel compiler
.sp
You will need to patch your Chapel 1.4.0 compiler using the following
command _after_ running ./configure:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
bash <builddir>/patch\-chapel\-compiler.sh
.ft P
.fi
.sp
The script will patch and recompile the compiler automatically. You
can undo this operation by running:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
bash <builddir>/patch\-chapel\-compiler.sh \-\-undo
.ft P
.fi
.sp
this will reverse the effects of the patch.
.SS User\-visible dependencies
.sp
If you just want to compile and install BRAID, you will need:
\- Python:                Version 2.6 or higher
\- gcc, ld, Perl, AWK, sed
.sp
If you want to run the regression tests, you will also need:

.SS User\(aqs Guide
.SS Anatomy of a Babel call
.sp
A call from one language into another starts with the client (the
caller) invoking a \fIstub\fP, which accepts all the arguments of the
method in the native data format (such as value representation or
memory layout) of the client language. The stub is automatically
generated by Braid/Babel and is usually output in the client\(aqs
language, or in C, if the native language is not expressive enough to
perform the argument conversion, which often involves byte\-level
memory manipulation. Stubs are very small and the compiler can
sometimes inline them. The stub converts the arguments into the
intermediate object representation (IOR) which is Babel\(aqs native data
format. It then calls the server implementation, which also has to
accept the IOR. On the server side resides a \fIskeleton\fP, which does
the reverse operation of converting the IOR into the native
representation of the server (callee). The skeleton invokes the
\fIimplementation\fP which is the actual method to be called. Upon return,
it converts all outgoing arguments and the return value into the IOR
and returns to the Stub, which performs the translation back to the
client\(aqs data format.
.SS Scientific Interface Definition Language (SIDL)
.sp
Braid cannot (yet) parse source code. In order to generate bindings
for a component the user needs to specify the interface that the
component provides in the SIDL format. A lengthy description of all
SIDL features can be found in the
.. _Babel Manual: \fI\%https://computation.llnl.gov/casc/components/docs/users_guide/\fP
, Chapter 6.
.SS Chapel Language Binding
.sp
This section describes how the various features of SIDL are mapped
onto Chapel constructs.
.SS Introduction
.sp
Chapel is a modern high\-level parallel programming language originally
developed by Cray Inc. as part of the DARPA HPCS program. In contrast
to traditional programming languages such as C++, the runtime system
of the language takes care of executing the code in parallel.  The
language still offers the user fine\-grained control over things such
as the data layout and the allocation of distributed data, but it
renders the tedious explicit encoding of communication through, e.g., a
message\-passing interface, obsolete.
.SS Basics
.sp
To see examples of how to use the Chapel language with Braid, please
refer to the many examples located in the \fCbraid/regression/interop\fP
directory. The corresponding SIDL files can be found in the Babel
sources the \fCregression\fP subdirectory.
.SS Static functions
.sp
Chapel classes cannot have static methods. BRAID will generate a
\fC<classname_>_static\fP module that contains all static methods
defined by the SIDL class \fIclassname\fP.
.SS Object lifecycle
.sp
Objects are created using the
\fC<classname_>_static.create(out exception)\fP
function. This indirection is necessary because constructors may throw
a SIDL exception. The
\fC<classname_>_static.wrap_<classname>(in obj, out exception)\fP
function can be used to create a Chapel version of an existing
externally created SIDL object.
.sp
Objects can be up\-casted by using the provided \fCas_<baseclass>()\fP
methods. Down\-casting can be down by using the generated
\fC<baseclass>_cast_<target>()\fP methods.
.SS Scalar datatypes
.sp
The following table lists the scalar types supported by SIDL and the
corresponding Chapel types used by the skeleton or stub while
converting Chapel code from or into the IOR.  The SIDL scalar types
are (with the exception of strings) of fixed length and were easy to
support especially since Chapel has parametric support for the number
of bits in the integral and floating point types which map to the same
representation as used by the IOR. It also has native types for both
single\-precision and double\-precision complex numbers and supports
\fIopaque\fP types that allow data to be passed around through Babel/BRAID
back into the original address space. Chapel also supports enumerated
type to defines a set of named constants.  On the other hand, the
Babel IOR and the Chapel compiler use different representations for
complex numbers, hence BRAID generates glue code to pass around
copies.  Since Chapel does not have a \fIchar\fP type, BRAID generates
code to convert Chapel unit\-length strings into chars using a
statically allocated lookup table.

Scalar Data Types in SIDL and their Chapel equivalents on a 64\-bit
machine.
.SS Array data types
.sp
SIDL arrays can be generated by using the \fCsidl.<type>_array.create()\fP
family of functions:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
var max_size = 1024;
var arr = sidl.double_array.create2dCol(max_size, max_size);
var a_meta = arr(1)
var a_data = arr(2)
for i in 0..#max_size do {
  for j in 0..#max_size do {
    a_data[i:int(32),j:int(32)] = 3.14;
  }
.ft P
.fi
.sp
The create functions return a tuple with SIDL\-related metadata and a
Chapel borrowed array. Borrowed arrays are an extension to Chapel;
they inherit all the syntactic sugar support Chapel provides
for natively defined arrays. Hence there is no change in the Chapel
code while using these arrays except during array creation. We require
a small extension to the Chapel compiler to support borrowed arrays.
Borrowed arrays have data blocks allocated external to the Chapel runtime
unlike traditional Chapel arrays where each array uses a data block
managed by the Chapel runtime. This avoids superfluous allocation and
deallocation of array data blocks while passing the array reference
between Babel/BRAID calls. It becomes the user\(aqs responsibility to manage
the memory while using borrowed arrays.
.sp
In the above example, a generic SIDL array<> version of the created
SIDL array could be accessed using the \fCa_meta.generic\fP data member.
Generic arrays are passed as Chapel \fCopaque\fP values. To cast them to
a proper sidl.Array, use the following code:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
proc generic_array_input(in ga: opaque /* array< > */) {
  var ga_meta = sidl.double_array.cast(ga);
  if ga_meta != nil then {
    var ga_data = createBorrowedArray1d(ga_meta);
    ga_data[0] = 42;
  }
}
.ft P
.fi
.sp
From the user\(aqs perspective there is no difference between Chapel
representation of SIDL arrays and R\-arrays. It should be noted that
non column\-major arrays will be automatically copied and converted in
the Chapel stub generated by BRAID.
.SS Exceptions
.sp
Chapel does not (yet) support exception handling. To throw an
exception, a Chapel method should create a new exception object and
assign it to the \fC_ex\fP argument before returning.
.SS Client\-side
.SS Implementation\-side
.SS UPC Language Binding
.sp
This section describes how the various features of SIDL are mapped
onto Unified Parallel C constructs.
.sp
Braid so far has been tested with Berkeley UPC v. 2.14.2.
.sp
TODO.
.SS Development status
.sp
BRAID is written in 98% Python; the SIDL scanner is implemented in
flex (C). Some of the Python sources are automatically generated from
a high\-level specification (sidl.def, ir.def) by a Prolog script. The
implementation language choice is motivated by Python being the
highest\-level language that we can assume to be pre\-installed on all
our target systems. So far we have three components:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
.
A complete parser for SIDL which generates an object\-oriented
intermediate representation (IR)
.IP \(bu 2
.
A converter to an extensible s\-expression\-based language
independent IR
.IP \(bu 2
.
Code generators that convert this IR into Chapel and C code.
Other languages supported by Babel will follow.
.sp
To facilitate the writing of these code generators we put some
effort into extending Python with a pattern\-matching mechanism
for arbitrarily complex tuples. (And the s\-expressions from the
IR are internally represented as Python tuples.)
