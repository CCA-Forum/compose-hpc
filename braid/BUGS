* BUGS *                                          -*- org -*-

This file lists known bugs and non-bugs that
often trip people up.  Most of these bugs are
the result of incompatibilities among compilers
and various Unix systems.

------------------------------------------------------------

* TODO Items *
** TODO Finish struct implementation for Objects and (R)Arrays
** TODO Implement contract checking for Chapel
  *** things we can leave for later:
  **** non-static version necessary only for knapsack
  **** statistics (gettimeofday)
  **** can directly call skeleton from check routines

** TODO Make Chapel-Chapel interoperability work
** TODO Implement final methods

** TODO Warn the user when braid would overwrite a file (especially stub-modules). 
   Maybe we can add a AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED line and check for that
   and only overwrite files if that line is present.
