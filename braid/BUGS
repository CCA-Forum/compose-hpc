* BUGS *                                          -*- org -*-

This file lists known bugs and non-bugs that
often trip people up.  Most of these bugs are
the result of incompatibilities among compilers
and various Unix systems.

------------------------------------------------------------

* TODO Items *
** TODO Finish struct implementation for Objects and (R)Arrays
** TODO Implement contract checking for Chapel
  *** things we can leave for later:
  **** non-static version necessary only for knapsack
  **** can directly call skeleton from check routines

** TODO Make Chapel-Chapel interoperability work
  *** only remaining problem is on the Chapel runtime side
** TODO Implement final methods
   
** TODO Warn the user when braid would overwrite a file (especially stub-modules). 
   Maybe we can add a AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED line and check for that
   and only overwrite files if that line is present.

** TODO error detection in SIDL parser
  *** versioned classes
  *** underscores in names

** TODO braid sprays parsetab.py all over the place
* HOWTO Information
** How do you add a new backend?
** What needs to be done to generate the IOR using the IR?
** How do you add a new IR node type?
*** Edit the braid/ir.def file to add the node type. Then you will need to braid/codegen.py. Add rules to the generic code generator. These are inherited, but you may need to customize other generators.
** How do you change the SIDL grammer?
*** Edit the braid/sidl.def file. This is a pseudo-BNF description of the grammar.
** BURG generates Python from rules.
