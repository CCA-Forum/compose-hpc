INTRODUCTION
============

  COMPOSE-HPC is a project dedicated to making tools of annotation
languages, source-to-source code transformation and code generation
more useful and accessible to the developers of scientific and 
engineering software for high-performance computers.

  Three tools are currently under development:

    PAUL: Annotation processor
    ROTE: Term rewriting
    BRAID: Code generation, SIDL parser, Language interoperability


DEPENDENCIES
============

    Build-only:
    Make:           GNU make version 3.74 or higher
    SWI-Prolog:     Version 5.10.4 or higher 
                    (only needed if you intend to modify [ir,sidl].def)
    Doxygen:        Version 1.6 or higher
