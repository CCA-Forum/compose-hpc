If working from the source repository, you need to generate the
autoconf/automake/libtool blob first:

% sh ./autogen.sh

Then, the usual configure/make process is used:

% ./configure --with-rosedir=[where_you_put_rose]
% make

Please refer to README for more details, especially if the above fails
due to missing libraries.  A few environment variables need to be set up
to make sure ROSE and BOOST can be found, and the README explains how.
