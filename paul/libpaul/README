libpaul : a library for flexible syntax source code annotations

1. Overview

2. Installation
---------------

First, make sure that the following libraries are installed:

- ROSE.

  http://www.rosecompiler.org/

- BOOST (used to build ROSE).

  http://www.boost.org/

- SFSexpr (s-expression parser and data structure support).

  http://sf.net/projects/sexpr/

This code has been tested with the latest ROSE available on the SciDAC
Outreach site as of mid-October 2011.  The BOOST version was 1.45.0 -
any version that ROSE is compatible with will work.  The SFSexp
library version used was 1.2.1.  Note that the SFSexp library doesn't
have an install target, so you just aim at the source tree.  (Version
of SFSexp with proper install and other common automake targets is on
the way..)

Once these are compiled/installed, set up your environment.  For
example:

% export ROSEINSTALL=/home/matt/packages/rose-latest/compileTree/
% export BOOSTINSTALL=/home/matt/packages/boost_1_45_0/installTree/
% export SEXPRINSTALL=/home/matt/packages/sexpr_1.2.1/src/

Once these are in place, make the example:

** TODO : currently need to say "make lemon", "make parser" and "make
   scanner" before typing the general "make" in order to generate the
   parser and scanner.  Need to set up dependencies in makefile to get
   these to fire automatically. **

% make

Run some tests:

% ./test_PaulDecorate tests/test1.cpp

We also have standalone testers for the annotation objects,
independent of ROSE.  These are good for testing the annotaitons in
isolation to avoid inducing bugs outside of them during the
development process.  (E.g., hitting ROSE bugs while debugging an
annotation object).

% make EXEC=test_KVAnnotation
% make EXEC=test_SVAnnotation
