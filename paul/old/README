This is an initial version of PAUL, currently capable of extracting
specially-formatted annotations from C source code.

Please direct questions, comments, and feedback to Geoff Hulette via email at
ghulett@sandia.gov.

See example/Example.c for a simple demonstration of PAUL's current annotation
format.

To build PAUL from source you will need:

  * The Haskell Platform, July 2010 or newer. Download from
    http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/ and follow the instructions for your
    platform.
  * You will need to install some dependencies via Cabal. The
    following commands should suffice:
    $ cabal install language-c
    $ cabal install language-c-comments

Note that the Language-C currently has an unfortunate dependency on GCC
for preprocessing, so you will need that C compiler. We are working on an
alternative, compiler-independent preprocessing step.

To build PAUL:

  $ cabal configure
  $ cabal build

To try it out:
  
  $ ./dist/build/paul/paul example/Example.c

Enjoy!
