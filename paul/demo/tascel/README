---------TASCEL TRANSFORMATION README------------

- Environment variables needed:

  PAUL_HOME (path to paul/demo folder),
  ROSE_HOME (path to ROSE installation),
  BOOST_HOME (path to BOOST installation)

- Coccinelle version (> 1.0.0-rc4) is needed
  for this transformation to work as desired.

- The input test file to be transformed should COMPILE
  without any errors. Forward declarations (or header includes)
  for any external/library function calls are mandatory for the 
  transformation to be successful.
  - See tascel/tests/twoel_0.c for example.


Running a sample transformation
-------------------------------
- The script Tascel.py in paul/demo folder is used
  to run the transformation.

- The options to this script are
  ./Tascel.py path-to-input-file AnnotOptions 
   where AnnotOptions={autoAnnot, autoAnnotNstop, PAUL} 
 
   - Currently automatically annotations is not supported.
     and hence AnnotOptions should be empty.

- python Tascel.py tascel/tests/twoel_0.c  (not providing AnnotOptions)


Actions performed by the Tascel.py script
----------------------------------------------

  - Assume test.c is the source file.
  - A SimpleTranslator built using ROSE processes the input file
    builds an AST and unparses it to generate rose_test.c
  - If autoAnnot option is provided rose_test.c is annotated
    and a new file rose_trans_test.c is generated with all
    desired calls (like next_4chunk()) annotated. If autoAnnot is not provided
    rose_trans_test.c would be a simple duplicate of rose_test.c
  - rose_trans_test.c is processed by PAUL and rose_trans_test_tascel.cocci
      is generated. This .cocci file is used by coccinelle
      to generate the final transformed code containing the transformed code
      named rose_trans_test_tascel.c

  NOTE: This script could be run from any location on your machine.
        All the files generated as part of the transformation are
        placed in the same directory as the original source file.


Linking options
---------------

- The original input file provided may need to be
  linked against libraries which the TASCEL transformation
  is unaware of. If these options are provided in the file
  $(PAUL_HOME)/tascel/linker, the transformed
  code will be compiled by the Tascel.py script 
  (THIS COMPILATION FEATURE IS NOT SUPPORTED CURRENTLY). 

Example for BLAS code (also found in linker file):
% -L$ATLAS_HOME/lib -lcblas -latlas

NOTE: The line with options must start with %

- If no include and/or library paths along with other required 
  libraries are given, the transformed code is left for the user
  to be compiled.


Work in Progress
----------------

- The transformations are applied in a series of steps thereby
  producing multiple versions of the transformed code, where each
  version is a step towards the final desired transformation.
  Currently only the intial version has been developed.

- Developing the other versions.
