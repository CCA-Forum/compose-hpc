INTRODUCTION
============

  This is the root directory for the PAUL Interface Contracts work.  It is 
currently maintained separate from the PAUL/libpaul work to allow for the
two to evolve separately.



SUBDIRECTORIES
==============

  The subdirectories contained within the Paul Contracts root are:

    ./conf        # Configuration file(s)
    ./examples    # Example programs with contract annotations
    ./include     # Include files
    ./src         # Source files
    ./tests       # Test programs (and inputs/data)
