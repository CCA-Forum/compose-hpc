INTRODUCTION
============

  PAUL interface contracts software is used to automatically translate
specially formatted structured comments, representing interface contracts,
into executable assertions whose checking can be driven by a variety of
enforcement options.  
 
  The software used to interpret PAUL contracts is maintained separately
from the PAUL library since the former is a specific class of PAUL structured
comments while the latter provides the foundational parsing, type mapping,
and annotation features.



SUBDIRECTORIES
==============

  The subdirectories in the Paul Contracts root distributed with content are:

    ./conf              # Configuration file(s) (Not currently used)
    ./dox               # Input files for Doxygen documentation generation
    ./include           # Include files (runtime and driver header files)
    ./src               # Source files
    ./src/contracts     # ...Contract Clause processing library sources
    ./src/drivers       # ...Programs for locating, printing, and/or 
                        #    transforming contract annotations in C/C++
    ./src/examples      # ...Example programs with contract annotations
                        # ......These programs are also used by tests.
    ./src/runtime       # ...Contract Clause Enforcement library sources
    ./src/tests         # ...Test programs and scripts
    ./src/tests/data    # ...Test oracle inputs

while contents within the following subdirectories are created after a build 
or check:

    ./bin               # Executables
    ./lib               # Libraries (runtime and instrumentation)
    ./results           # Sources and output from 'make check'/'make checkall'



ENVIRONMENT SETTINGS
====================

There are environment variables required to be set prior to attempting to
build or test the software.  The variables that must be set are:

  PCONTRACTS_HOME  = path to the PAUL Contracts directory
  BOOST_HOME       = path to the BOOST installation directory for the version
                     of BOOST used when ROSE was built
  ROSE_HOME        = path to the ROSE installation directory

In addition, the LD_LIBRARY_PATH will need to include the following directories:

  LD_LIBRARY_PATH  += path to the directory containing libjvm.so of the
                      Java installation used to build ROSE
                   += path ${ROSE_HOME}/lib

A shell script (setup.sh) has been provided in the PCONTRACTS_HOME directory.
You will need to modify the script to provide the correct paths for your
system.

If you are running from c shell, you can use the build.sh script to build
the software.  The script sets up the required environment variables
before passing the first command line argument it is given, if any, to make.



BUILD
=====

  The software is built, tested, documented, and directories cleaned through 
simple makefile invocations on the command line.


BASICS
------

  The translation software can be built through a simple makefile invocation
at the command line, where '$' indicates the command line prompt:

  $ make
or
  $ sh build.sh



TESTS AND EXAMPLES
------------------

  Basic infrastructure, example, and driver program tests are executed through
the check rule:

  $ make check
or
  $ sh build.sh check

This rule executes and verifies the results of tests of the runtime library,
input source files, and driver programs.  Input source files are checked to 
ensure they build and are (still) functioning.  Only the success (or failure) 
of the traversal and transformation processes of the driver programs, which 
all involve traversing the abstract syntax tree (AST) of the input source 
files, is verified.

  Checking transformed source files is included with the above checks using the
checkall rule, as follows:

  $ make checkall
or
  $ sh build.sh checkall

Using this rule adds building, executing, and checking the results of the 
instrumented source files -- with enforcement enabled and disabled.

  The executing of either check rule leads to the creation/population of a 
results subdirectory containing outputs from the processes.  Results of
executing programs are generally redirected to files with .mout extensions.
Any comparisons with oracle files are redirected to files with .diff extensions.
Enforcement statistics and trace information, if any, are redirected to files
having .csv extensions.  These files are automatically removed, however, when
directories are cleaned.


Known Test Case Failures
------------------------
The following test cases are known to fail:

- SimpleClass.cpp generated with RoutineInstrumenter
  This case currently fails due to issues with the generated code using the
  return variable incorrectly and not declaring the return variable in 
  branches where it is a hard coded value (of zero).



CLEANING DIRECTORIES
--------------------

  Basic file cleanup -- of object and output files --  is performed using the
clean rule as follows:

  $ make clean
or
  $ sh build.sh clean

while all files, including documentation, are removed with the cleanall rule:

  $ make cleanall
or
  $ sh build.sh cleanall



DOCUMENTATION
=============

  PAUL contracts documentation is generated using Doxygen and GraphViz with
the docs rule as follows:

  $ make docs
or
  $ sh build.sh docs

where you can navigate to and open the index.html file with a web browser to
see information about the classes and files in this package.

  The generated documentation can be removed with the cleandocs rule:

  $ make cleandocs
or
  $ sh build.sh cleandocs
