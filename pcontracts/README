INTRODUCTION
============

  PAUL interface contracts software is used to automatically translate
specially formatted structured comments, representing interface contracts,
into executable assertions whose checking can be driven by a variety of
enforcement options.  
 
  The software used to interpret PAUL contracts is maintained separately
from the PAUL library since the former is a specific class of PAUL structured
comments while the latter provides the foundational parsing, type mapping,
and annotation features.



SUBDIRECTORIES
==============

  The subdirectories contained within the Paul Contracts root are:

    ./conf              # Configuration file(s) (TBD)
    ./include           # Include files (TBD)
    ./src               # Source files
    ./src/examples      # ...Example programs 
                        # ......With contract annotations
                        # ......Related ROSE codes
    ./src/runtime       # ...Runtime library(ies)
                        # ......Stand-alone contract enforcement
    ./src/tests         # ...Test programs (runtime)

while the following subdirectories are created after a build and/or check:

    ./lib               # The runtime library
    ./results           # Sources and output from example 



BUILD
=====

  The translation software can be built through a simple makefile invocation
at the command line:

  $ make

  Basic tests can be executed, with rudimentary results comparisons, through
the check rule:

  $ make check

where results of a variety of translation examples can be found in files
with .mout extensions and, when provided, comparisons between translations
in files with .diffs extensions.  

  Basic file cleanup -- of object and output files --  is performed using the
clean rule:

  $ make clean

while all files, including documentation, are removed with the cleanall rule:

  $ make cleanall



DOCUMENTATION
=============

  PAUL contracts documentation is generated using Doxygen and GraphViz using
the docs rule:

  $ make docs

where you can navigate to and open the index.html file with a web browser to
see information about the classes and files in this package.
