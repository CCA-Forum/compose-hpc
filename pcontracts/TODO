PROTOTYPE
- Convert generated enforcement calls to macros with optional lib calls

- Support INIT and FINAL as in-lined annotations (ie, NOT [just] function)
  where generate in-place.

- Convert to ROSE visitor to:
  -- Ensure pick up invariant annotations
  -- Support INIT and FINAL in-lined annotations
   
- Expand supported enforcement options
  -- Initial version expected to only translate basic assertion expressions
     (ie, those containing C operators).
  -- Add SIDL built-in equivalents to the stand-alone library

Refinements:
- Support advanced (non-standard C) contract expressions
     (ie, those containing non-C operators supported in SIDL built-ins)

- TBD: Should Babel/SIDL tracing equivalent be supported?


LIBPAUL
- Integrate j
