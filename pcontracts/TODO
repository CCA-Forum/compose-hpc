PROTOTYPE
- Convert to ROSE visitor to:
  -- Ensure pick up invariant annotations
  -- Support INIT and FINAL within bodies as alternative to being associated
     with function.
   
Refinements:
- Support advanced (non-standard C) contract expressions
     (ie, those containing non-C operators supported in SIDL built-ins)

- TBD: Should Babel/SIDL tracing equivalent be supported?


LIBPAUL
- Refactor ContractInstrumenter example to fit within PaulDecorator
  -- Contract parser implementation
  -- Contract annotation
