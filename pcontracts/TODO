PROTOTYPE

Address:
- Resolve issue where first is true multiple once in prechecks and again in
  postchecks.


Refinements:
- Add support for instrumentation related to node-level CONTRACT ASSERT 
  statements.  HOWEVER, these will require modifications to adaptive
  enforcement options if they are to be sampled as well.
- Move runtime headers to include directory and adjust build accordingly.
- Support advanced (non-standard C) contract expressions
     (ie, those containing non-C operators supported in SIDL built-ins)
- Test or eliminate support for contract tracing.
- Ensure build failures in rose examples accounted for in 'make check' results.
  (Assumes skipping 'make' step.)

   

LIBPAUL
- Develop ties and links to contract instrumentation work
  -- Investigate Adrian's work on this
- Add related unit test(s)
