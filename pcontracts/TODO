PROTOTYPE
- Convert to ROSE visitor to:
  -- Ensure pick up invariant annotations
  -- Support INIT and FINAL within bodies as alternative to being associated
     with function.
   
Refinements:
- Support advanced (non-standard C) contract expressions
     (ie, those containing non-C operators supported in SIDL built-ins)

- TBD: Should Babel/SIDL tracing equivalent be supported?


LIBPAUL
Principle:  libpaul provides parsing, type map, and annotation NOT visit or
interpretation.  So keep contracts in pcontracts but link to libpaul.

- Develop contract annotation based on ContractInstrumenter work
- Add unit test for contract annotation
- Add test case creating and printing contract annotation
