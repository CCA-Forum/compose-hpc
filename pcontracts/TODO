PROTOTYPE

- Convert to ROSE visitor to:
  -- Add atTraversal[Start|End] methods to VisitContractsInstrumenter.*pp
  -- Finish refactoring ContractsProcessor, which may need a subclass
     containing the instrumentFunctions(?) routine for the routine 
     instrumenter.
  -- Ensure pick up invariant annotations
  -- Support INIT and FINAL within bodies as alternative to being associated
     with function.
- Move runtime headers to include directory and adjust build accordingly.
   
Refinements:
- Support advanced (non-standard C) contract expressions
     (ie, those containing non-C operators supported in SIDL built-ins)
- Test or eliminate support for contract tracing.


LIBPAUL
- Develop ties and links to contract instrumentation work
- Add related unit test(s)
