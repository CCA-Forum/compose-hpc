PROTOTYPE


- Complete support for partial enforcement strategies.
  This involves, on first pass, implementing support for the configuration file.



Refinements:
- Move runtime headers to include directory and adjust build accordingly.
- Support advanced (non-standard C) contract expressions
     (ie, those containing non-C operators supported in SIDL built-ins)
- Test or eliminate support for contract tracing.
- Ensure build failures in rose examples accounted for in 'make check' results.
  (Assumes skipping 'make' step.)

   

LIBPAUL
- Develop ties and links to contract instrumentation work
  -- Investigate Adrian's work on this
- Add related unit test(s)
