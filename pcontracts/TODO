PROTOTYPE
- Resolve post-first routine invariant generation.

- Expand supported enforcement options
  -- Initial version expected to only translate basic assertion expressions
     (ie, those containing C operators).
  -- Add SIDL built-in equivalents to the stand-alone library

TBD:  Should Babel/SIDL tracing equivalent be supported?


LIBPAUL
- Continue preliminary identification of relevant libpaul features
  -- Resume work on:
     o PaulContractsDecorator

- Extend libpaul/PaulDecorate (or revision) with support for new parsers
  and new annotation node support
  -- Depends on tag-parser generalizations and support for multiple 
     annotation attributes per node as proposed at the coding camp



*** Refinement:
- Support advanced (non-standard C) contract expressions
     (ie, those containing non-C operators supported by Babel)
