PROTOTYPE

- Resolve issues with Visitor instrumentation example.

- Should customize the makefile used to build instrumented codes
  to account for the fact that helloworld-v2.cc WILL NOT COMPILE
  when instrumented with RoutineContractInstrumenter since it
  has INIT and FINAL embeddeed in a function and NOT in the
  function comments.

- Convert ROSE visitor to:
  -- Implement node-level extractContractClause (ContractsProcessor)

  -- Support invariant annotations on non-function declaration nodes.
     o These are simply stored until needed.
     o Need to ensure the 'first' flag is set properly when they are
       actually needed.
  
  -- Support INIT and FINAL within bodies as alternative to being associated
     with function declaration.
     o These MUST be instrumented BEFORE the node associated with the 
       comment. 

- Move runtime headers to include directory and adjust build accordingly.


Refinements:
- Add support for statement-level ASSERT
  -- The instrumentation MUST be BEFORE the associated node based on how
     ROSE picks up the comments.
  -- This includes adding options to support ASSERT-only enforcement and
     ASSERT with contract clause options.
  -- Note these are not suited to adaptive enforcement options as written.
- Support advanced (non-standard C) contract expressions
     (ie, those containing non-C operators supported in SIDL built-ins)
- Test or eliminate support for contract tracing.
- Ensure build failures in rose examples accounted for in 'make check' results.
  (Assumes skipping 'make' step.)
   

LIBPAUL
- Develop ties and links to contract instrumentation work
- Add related unit test(s)
