PROTOTYPE

- Complete support for partial enforcement strategies.
  -- Complete testing and debugging of STATS.

  -- Add support for an in-lined TRACE comment to output enforcement trace
     information (provided a trace file was specified in the configuration).
     (This will require restoration of timing instrumentation.)

Refinements:
- Move runtime headers to include directory and adjust build accordingly.
- Support advanced (non-standard C) contract expressions
     (ie, those containing non-C operators supported in SIDL built-ins)
- Test or eliminate support for contract tracing through new contract
  annotation.
- Ensure build failures in rose examples accounted for in 'make check' results.
  (Assumes skipping 'make' step.)


Lower Priority Refinements:
- Support multiple enforcers (and configurations).
- Support routine-specific time estimates (as had been done in Babel).
- Add tests (testContractsEnforcer) for the initialization routine.


   

LIBPAUL
- Develop ties and links to contract instrumentation work
  -- Investigate Adrian's work on this
- Add related unit test(s)
