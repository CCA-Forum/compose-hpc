PROTOTYPE

Address:
- Determine why the contracts visitor is not generating output.
- Ensure INVARIANT checks added _even when_ the precondition(s) and or post-
  condition(s) are non-executable.
- The 'first' flag needs to be set properly in instrumented contract checks.
  (Currently always set to FALSE.)
- Ensure node-level INIT and FINAL instrumentation is added BEFORE the 
  associated node.


Refinements:
- Add support for instrumentation related to node-level CONTRACT ASSERT 
  statements.  HOWEVER, these will require modifications to adaptive
  enforcement options.
- Move runtime headers to include directory and adjust build accordingly.
- Support advanced (non-standard C) contract expressions
     (ie, those containing non-C operators supported in SIDL built-ins)
- Test or eliminate support for contract tracing.
- Ensure build failures in rose examples accounted for in 'make check' results.
  (Assumes skipping 'make' step.)
- Should customize the makefile used to build instrumented codes
  to account for the fact that helloworld-v2.cc WILL NOT COMPILE
  when instrumented with RoutineContractInstrumenter since it
  has INIT and FINAL embeddeed in a function and NOT in the
  function comments.

   

LIBPAUL
- Develop ties and links to contract instrumentation work
  -- Investigate Adrian's work on this
- Add related unit test(s)
