PROTOTYPE

HIGH:
- Finish writing up document describing what this work is about, benefits, and
  how to use it.  Distribute to collaborators!


MODERATE:
- TBD: Complete testing and debugging of STATS support.
  -- TBD: Where should pre-routine STATS be instrumented?
     (Now blanket adding before finalize regardless of annotation location.)

  -- Need to resolve in-lined STATS not being translated (since currently
     treating like FINAL).  Review whether distinguishing between inlined
     and pre-routine annotations.

- TBD: How should finer grained timing data be acquired for partial
  enforcement strategies?
  -- Support what could be considered default timing data added to each
     executable annotation?
  -- CONTRACT TIMING ?


Refinements:
- TRACE annotation support (optional?)
  -- Add support for an in-lined TRACE comment to output enforcement trace
     information (provided a trace file was specified in the configuration).
     (This will require restoration of timing instrumentation.)
  -- Complete testing and debugging

- Support advanced (non-standard C) contract expressions
     (ie, those containing non-C operators supported in SIDL built-ins)


Lower Priority Refinements:
- Support multiple enforcers (and configurations).
- Support routine-specific time estimates (as had been done in Babel).
- Add tests (testContractsEnforcer) for the initialization routine.


   

LIBPAUL
- Develop ties and links to contract instrumentation work
  -- Investigate Adrian's work on this
- Add related unit test(s)
