  These files represent a WORK IN PROGRESS.  Consequently the tentative 
contents are based on a very preliminary, "stream of consciousness"
pass at identifying relevant libpaul features and POTENTIAL approaches to
getting the interface contracts work going.  

Also note the SimpleClass.cpp example's test of the generated code is known
to fail on an older version of Rose (without Edg-4) since it doesn't add the
invariant before the implicit return at the end of the checkValue method.
While the VisitContractInstrumenter adds invariant checks to the returns
within the checkValue method's switch statement, the same cannot be said
for the RoutineContractInstrumenter.
