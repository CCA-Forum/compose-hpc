\tableofcontents

A number of programs contained in this package serve either as drivers,
programs used to traverse input source file abstract syntax trees (ASTs), 
or input source files that can, themselves, be executed.


\section programs_sec Driver Programs

Driver programs, listed in the table below, recognize and process contract 
comment annotations in C/C++ source files.
There are two types of drivers:  traversal and transformation. 
Traversal drivers simply walk the abstract syntax tree (AST) and print
information about any contract annotations detected.
Additionally, transformation drivers insert the corresponding enforcement 
instrumentation.

\section example_inputs_sec Annotated Input Programs

There are several very basic programs used as input source files for the
driver programs.
Each input program contains contract annotations in the comments of
routines and or inlined within routines.
The table below lists the associated CONTRACT annotations and summarizes
the intention of each program.
